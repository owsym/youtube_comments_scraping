# youtube_comments_scraping
1: Write a Python program which should visit a youtube video, and scrape its comments. You should store all the comments in a CSV file. For example, if you visit this video of my mentor and employer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zghBofrKv7s, scrape all the comments of this video and store in a CSV file. The CSV file should have these columns: user name, user's thumbnail URL (profile image basically), commented at time, comment text and number of likes. The name of CSV file should be the video's name.

2: Write a Python program which takes input a youtube channel link, and create a CSV file in a folder, named against the youtube username, for each and every video on that channel. For example, if you give it the input of https://www.youtube.com/@ehmadzubair, it should create a folder named ehmadzubair which should have 67 separate CSV files in it (because the channel has 67 videos as of now)

3: coming soon...
